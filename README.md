# ABOUT
<h3 class="text-center">This game was made in Godot in 12 hours for a Game Dev GAUNTLET challenge: "No Letter E".</h3>
<p class="text-center"> Check out the entire, livestreamed-development here!

<p class="text-center">The challenge was to not use the letter E in any of the game's .gd script files, except for "extends" at the top of the script.</p>
<p class="text-center">Nodes added&nbsp;to the scene tree also had to not have the letter "E" in them and they couldn't have their original names changed, only appended to.</p>
<p class="text-center">The letter "E" is not present in any on screen text either!</p>

<p class="text-center">Finally, for every hour I didn't finish the game, the chat would vote on a new theme I had to incorporate... I got them all (relative to their context) except for the last one, "Background"!</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Extra themes: Storms, Cats, Gravity, Bees, Bubbles, Big ol Dog, Goats, Merge n Pull, More Cats, Just Finish It, and Background.</strong></p>

<h3 class="text-center">It was so difficult...</h3>
<h3 class="text-center">But I learned a ton and had lots of help from the Hyper Game Dev community.</h3>
